# Single Responsibility Principle SRP

- cohesion
- single focus

Every class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software

- the responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class
- all its methods should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility
- a class should have only one job

SRP is about limiting the impact of change by designing [loosely coupled](../../oop/fundamental_oop_concepts.md#coupling) classes that are [highly cohesive](../../oop/fundamental_oop_concepts.md#cohesion)
