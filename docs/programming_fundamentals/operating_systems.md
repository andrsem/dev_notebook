# Operating Systems

## Kernel

The kernel is the lowest level of any operating system. It is responsible for the CPU resources, memory resources, file system, drivers, networking. The kernel is the lowest level software above the hardware.

## CPU

Consists of

- Memory unit - stores binary data
- Arithmetic and logic unit ALU - processes binary data
- Control unit - reads machine code from the memory unit. One instruction at a time. And causes other components ALU and memory to do things based on machine code. E.g. activate ADD unit in ALU and store result in a particular place in the memory unit
